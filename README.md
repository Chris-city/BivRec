# BivRec
In order to facilitate the follow-up work, we provide five versions of the code, respectively:

Comi: Multiple interest recommendation model
https://github.com/ShiningCosmos/pytorch_ComiRec.git

PureID/MM: Use interest-structured modules and ID or multimodal information for recommendations

PureID/MM+constraint: Adds a constraint to perform constraints

BivRec-normal: Interest structured module is not used for multi-mode feature extraction, but splicing and other methods are used as supervisory signals.

Bivrec-noi: indicates BivRec

The code is being sorted out.
